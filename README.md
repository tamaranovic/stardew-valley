This project is a student assignment inspired by the game Stardew Valley, focused on user interface and user experience (UI/UX). The aim was to present essential information about the game, including storyline, locations, mechanics and additional content, through a responsive and well-structured web design. The project was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as part of a Web Design course.
